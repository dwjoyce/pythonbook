    .. Starting with Python's IDLE

    pseudo-code
        A description of how your program works in simple English, without any unnecessary details of how it will be written.

    IDLE
        IDLE is the Python IDE.

    integrated development environment
        An integrated development environment (IDE) is a program that allows you to write, run and debug your code.  Some IDE programs provide extra tools to allow you to write the code faster such as code highlighting and automatic code completion.

    interactive shell
        A simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes user inputs (e.g. a single line of code or a loop), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user.

    run
    execute
        To perform the actions represented by the code.
        
    statement
        A line of code that performs an action.  A compound statement is a statement that performs a block of code selectively or iteratively (e.g. an ``if`` or ``while`` statement).

    .. Python as a Calculator

    expression
        A combination of actual values, variables, operators, calls to functions and even sub-expressions, to form a value that is computed or evaulated into its simplest form.  For example, the expression ``10 + 4 * 3 / 2`` is evaluated to form the value 16.0.

    operator
        A symbol that represents an action, such as addition, assignment or equality.

    integer
        A whole number such as 18. These numbers never have a fractional part.

    float
        A floating point number is a number that has a fractional part, such as 1.78, even if the fractional part is zero.

    integer division
    floor division
        An division where the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number.

    modulus
        The remainder when the first number is divided by the second.

    type
    class
        A set of values having the same behaviour (but typically differing in state), or a template defining such a set.  A type is a particular class of data, such as integers, lists or files.

    .. Naming your data

    variable
        A named memory location in which a program can store intermediate results and from which it can read and modify them.
        
    evaluation
        The process of computing a result.

    .. Functions and Maths

    call
        Execute or run a :term:`function` with the necessary :term:`arguments`.

    function
        A section of code that implements a task and :term:`returns` a value, even if that value is empty.

    built-in function
        A function that comes with Python, so you do not need to implement it yourself, such as ``round``, ``print`` and ``input``.

    argument
        A value, or reference to a value, passed into a :term:`function`.

    return value
        The data passed back from a called :term:`function`.

    .. Drawing Turtles



    .. Getting help

    module
        A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements, e.g. a program that can be used by others.

    dir
        A :term:`built-in function` that provides a directory listing of what is contained inside an object such as a module.

    .. First program

    .py
        The file extension that all python files should use.

    editor
        A program for creating and making changes to files, especially text files.

    .. Print that out!

    string concatenation
        The operation of joining multiple strings into one string.

    .. Asking questions



    .. Performing selection
    
    selection
        The process of executing one piece (block) of code over another selectively.

    code block
        A block is a piece of Python code that is executed as a unit.

    indentation
        Beginning a line with one or more spaces. Used to distinguish code blocks.

    .. Decisions, decisions

    boolean
        A data type that can only have the values ``True`` and ``False``.

    .. Combining decisions together

    boolean operator
    logical operator
        An operator, such as ``and`` that always results in a :term:`boolean` result, or boolean-convertible result.  For example, ``a == 10`` or ``a < 0 or a > 100``.

    .. Going loopy
    
    iteration
        The process where a set of instructions or data are repeated.

    .. Escaping the cycle

    infinite loop
        A loop which continues indefinitely.

    .. Going random

    random
        Unpredictable in value.

    .. Grouping data together

    matrix
        A two-dimensional list or list of lists, such as::

            matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
                      [4, 5, 6],
                      [7, 8, 9]]

    .. Slicing sequences



    .. Walking along data



    .. Naming code

    function definition
        A statement which creates a :term:`function`, such as::

            def add(a, b):
                return a + b

    .. More on functions

    positional arguments
        An :term:`argument` identified by its position in the list of arguments.

    .. Reading files



    .. Writing files



    .. Catching errors

    exception
        An interruption in normal processing, especially as caused by an error.
