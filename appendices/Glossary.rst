    .. Starting with Python's IDLE

    pseudo-code
        A description of a computer programming algorithm that uses the structural conventions of programming languages but omits detailed subroutines or language-specific syntax.

    IDLE
        IDLE is the Python IDE.

    integrated development environment
        An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion.

    interactive shell
        A simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user.

    run
    execute
        To perform the actions represented by the code.

    .. Python as a Calculator

    operator
        A symbol that represents an action.

    integer
        A whole number such as 18. These numbers never have a fractional part.

    float
        A floating point number is a number that can have a fractional part, such as 1.78.

    integer division
    floor division
        An division where the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number.

    modulus
        The remainder when the first number is divided by the second.

    type
    class
        A set of objects having the same behaviour (but typically differing in state), or a template defining such a set.

    .. Naming your data

    variable
        A named memory location in which a program can store intermediate results and from which it can read them.

    .. Functions and Maths

    call
        Execute a :term:`function` with the necessary :term:`arguments`.

    function
        A section of code, called by another section of code, that implements a task and may :term:`return` a value.

    built-in function
        A function that comes with python, so you do not need to implement it.

    argument
        A value, or reference to a value, passed to a :term:`function`.

    return value
        The data passed back from a called :term:`function`.

    .. Drawing Turtles



    .. Getting help

    module
        A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.

    directory function
        A :term:`built-in function` that returns a list of valid attributes for that object.

    .. First program

    .py
        The file extension that all python files should use.

    editor
        A program for creating and making changes to files, especially text files.

    .. Print that out!

    string concatenation
        The operation of joining multiple strings into one string.

    .. Asking questions



    .. Performing selection

    code block
        A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit.

    indentation
        Beginning a line with one or more spaces. Used to distinguish code blocks.

    .. Decisions, decisions

    boolean

    .. Combining decisions together

    boolean operator
    logical operator
        An operator, such as ``and``, that always results in a :term:`boolean` result, or boolean-convertible result.

    .. Going loopy



    .. Escaping the cycle

    infinite loop
        A loop which continues indefinitely.

    .. Going random

    random
        Unpredictable in value.

    .. Grouping data together

    matrix
        A two-dimensional list or list of lists, such as::

            matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
                      [4, 5, 6],
                      [7, 8, 9]]

    .. Slicing sequences



    .. Walking along data



    .. Naming code

    function definition
        A statement which creates a :term:`function`, like::

            def f(a, b):
                return a + b

    .. More on functions
